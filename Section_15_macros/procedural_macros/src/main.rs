    // procedural macros are used to generate code at compile time by taking a pice of code as input and returning a transformed version of that code

    // cargo new macros --lib

    // there are 3 types of procedural macros:

    // 1. Attribute macro: used to add metadata to items in rust such as functions, structs, enums, and others

    // 2. Function like macro: it is used to define functions--> they take arguments and generate code blocks that is then included in the program (these are the ones we saw)

    // 3. Derive macros: They are used to automatically implement traits on structs or enums (we have already used then)


    // ATTRIBUTE MACRO EXAMPLE:

    // (go to the library)
}
